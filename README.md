Being a self-taught **data scientist** is quite challenging. There are many factors that i have to face in order to advance this field. That's why i would like to take notes for every online courses that i will take in Databricks Academy. I hope i can reinforce my learning rate into the right skills that could be implemented in my new career as a Data Scientist. This certification workshop is taken from one of the workshop from Databricks called [Data Scientist learning path](https://academy.databricks.com/data-scientist). The exercises and activities will be excuted in Jupyter Notebooks through Databricks platform. The course is really comprehensive through theory and practical implementation.
